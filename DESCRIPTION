Description: Provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures on networks.
    Included are functions to compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and Bader's
    SNAP library), implementations of constraint and effective network size by Burt (2000) <doi:10.1016/S0191-3085(00)22009-1>; algorithm 
    to identify key players by Borgatti (2006) <doi:10.1007/s10588-006-7084-x>; and the 
    bridging algorithm by Valente and Fujimoto (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.003>. 
    On Unix systems, the betweenness, Key Players, and
    bridging implementations are parallelized with OpenMP, which may run
    faster on systems which have OpenMP configured.
